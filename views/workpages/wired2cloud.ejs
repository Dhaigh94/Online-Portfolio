<p class="text-center">Wired2cloud Late November 2015 my team did testing for a start-up company called Wired2Cloud on their application called AGLO, 
<br>which lets the user get cash for going to a store and taking a photo of the shelf a Brand’s product is on. 
The Brand then pays a ‘cashback’ <br>which is a small amount of money that is sent to the user’s PayPal account for that service.</p>
<p class="text-center">The app allows the user to find stores within a 20km radius using the phone’s GPS, which offers the cashback.</p>
<p class="text-center">For Wired2Cloud’s product to be successful, there are a few key things that mattered to their investors; 
the Brands, the users and the founder.</p>
<uL>
    <li>That the features were basic and that they worked.</li>
    <li>The product and its value proposition made sense to the users, they believed it enough that they would take photos in order to get cashbacks.</li>
    <li>That the photos of the shelves and brand products would be clear.</li>
    <li>That when taking the photo, the GPS location will confirm that the user is within the right retail store.</li>
</uL>
<p class="text-center">Given the above we decided to do field testing, taking the point of view of the Cashback Shopper. 
We did the entire End to End user experience <br>with the application and their shopping experience. 
We reported our bugs via a Trello board and an Excel report. Since last year I continue to test the AGLO application.</p>
