<div class="container">
<p class="text-center">My name is David and I am currently working at Qantas Loyalty in their Money and Insurance department, where I am testing their Money and Insurance product from the Front and Back End.
<br>
   This is an online portfolio I've developed from scratch to demonstrate my skills in front-end development, 
   software test and support. I was part of WorkVentures “KickStart Academy in Software Testing”. 
   It was a 3 months course. The trainers were Anne Marie Charrett and Catherine Karena. 
   It was project based. I tested with 10 different companies, this portfolio covers the type of work I did and what I learnt.
   After the course, I was working at CareerVentures as Business and Technical Support.
   I also did a 6-week internship for Kartel Digital and have continued to the test the new upgrades for Wired2Cloud.</p>
